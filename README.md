I had to look up the average percentage change formula since this is something I haven't had to calculate since my freshman year of college in General Chemistry 1. 
I wasn't sure of how to add the parantheses around the Greatest Increase and Decrease in Profits on my txt file, so those were left out. 

PyPoll

There is a "main_revised.py" file and a "main.py" file. My original submission is the "main.py" file. However the central grader said that they were not able to get the file to run... and I needed to resubmit my assignment. Therefore I left the original file intact and am now uploading a revised file with updated scripts.


This code was inspired from a post I saw on Stack Overflow
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12282232/how-do-i-count-occurrence-of-unique-values-inside-a-list

complete list of candidates who received votes
names = {}
for item in candidates:
    names[item] = names.get(item, 0) + 1

My code doesn't elegantly output all the information for the user/reader and required me to hard write some of my values. Next time with a little more time I would find a way to elegantly output ALL the values. The method I used still allows me to get all of the information required, just not displayed in an easier way.
